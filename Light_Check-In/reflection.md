I believe that I am making good progress with this project. I have working a lot on ensuring the datasets are as complete as possible. I am worried about having enough time to get all the data and features into this software before the semester due date. This project is my main focus this semester so I have been putting a lot of time and effort into it. I have really enjoyed working on this and would be interested in publishing it in the future.
