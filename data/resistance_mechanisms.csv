1001,antibiotic target alteration,"Mutational alteration or enzymatic modification of antibiotic target which results in antibiotic resistance."
1002,antibiotic target replacement,"Replacement or substitution of antibiotic action target; which process will result in antibiotic resistance."
1003,antibiotic target protection,"Protection of antibiotic action target from antibiotic binding; which process will result in antibiotic resistance."
1004,antibiotic inactivation,"Drug enzymatic inactivation drug enzymatic modification."
10000,antibiotic efflux,"Antibiotic resistance via the transport of antibiotics out of the cell."
10002,major facilitator superfamily (MFS) 10000 pump,"Directed pumping of antibiotic out of a cell to confer resistance. Major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters and ABC transporters comprise the two largest and most functionally diverse of the transporter superfamilies. However; MFS transporters are distinct from ABC transporters in both their primary sequence and structure and in the mechanism of energy coupling. As secondary transporters they are; like RND and SMR transporters; energized by the electrochemical proton gradient."
10003,small multidrug resistance (SMR) antibiotic efflux pump,"Directed pumping of antibiotic out of a cell to confer resistance. Small multidrug resistance (SMR) proteins are a relatively small family of transporters; restricted to prokaryotic cells. They are also the smallest multidrug transporters; with only four transmembrane alpha-helices and no significant extramembrane domain."
3000112,multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporter,"Directed pumping of antibiotic out of a cell to confer resistance. Multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters utilize the cationic gradient across the membrane as an energy source. Although there is a diverse substrate specificity; almost all MATE transporters recognize fluoroquinolones. Arciflavine; ethidium and aminoglycosides are also good substrates."
3000244,reduced permeability to antibiotic,"Reduction in permeability to antibiotic; generally through reduced production of porins; can provide resistance."
3000465,ole glycosyltransferase,"OleI and OleD are glycosyltransferases found in Streptomyces antibioticus which is a natural producer of antibiotic oleandomycin. OleI glycosylates antibiotic oleandomycin whereas OleD can glycosylate a wide variety of macrolides."
3003764,resistance by absence,"Mechanism of antibiotic resistance conferred by deletion of gene (usually a porin)."
3007103,nitroimidazole reductase,"Nitroimidazole reductases are a group of enzymes that deactivate nitroimidazole antibiotics by reducing their nitro functional group to an amino group. These enzymes are associated with resistance to nitroimidazole derivatives in Bacteroides fragilis but have also been reported in a variety of anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive genera. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for these enzymes vary greatly depending on species; strain; and precise nitroimidazole treatment used."
3007292,MCR phosphoethanolamine transferase inhibitor,"Adjuvants shown to inhibit the action of mobile colistin resistance phosphoethanolamine transferase genes."
3007424,resistance by host-dependent nutrient acquisition,"Resistance via uptake of host nutrients to bypass antibiotic mechanism."
