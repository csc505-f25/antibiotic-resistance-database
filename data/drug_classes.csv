drug_class_id,name,description
J01A,Tetracyclines,"This group comprises tetracycline antibacterials inhibiting the bacterial protein synthesis through binding to the 30-S part of ribosomes."
J01B,Amphenicols,"This group comprises amphenicol antibacterials inhibiting the bacterial protein synthesis. Thiamphenicol acetylcysteinate glycinate for inhalation is classified in J01BA52."
J01C,Penicillins (extended spectrum),"This group comprises penicillin beta-lactam antibacterials inhibiting the bacterial cell wall synthesis. Combinations of penicillins from different 4th levels including beta-lactamase inhibitors are classified in J01CR."
J01DB,First-generation cephalosporins,"The first generation compounds have relatively narrow spectrum of activity focused primarily on the gram-positive cocci."
J01DC,Second-generation cephalosporins,"The second generation cephalosporins have a variable activity against gram-positive cocci but have increased activity against gram-negative bacteria. The cephamycin group is included in the second-generation cephalosporins."
J01DD,Third-generation cephalosporins,"The third generation cephalosporins have a marked activity against gram-negative bacteria. Limited activity against gram-positive cocci particularly methicillin susceptible S. aureus might occur."
J01DE,Fourth-generation cephalosporins,"The fourth generation cephalosporins have activity against gram-positive cocci and a broad array of gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa and many of the Enterobacteriaceae with inducible chromosomal b-lactamases."
J01DF,Monobactams,"Arginin and lysine salts of aztreonam are classified in J01DF01; thus aztreonam for inhalation is classified together with systemic formulations."
J01DH,Carbapenems,"The DDD for meropenem is based on treatment of severe infections."
J01DI,Other cephalosporins and penems,
J01EA,Trimethoprim and derivatives,"The DDDs are based on the treatment of acute urinary-tract infections."
J01EB,Short-acting sulfonamides,"This group comprises sulfonamides with a biological half-life not exceeding approx. 7 hours."
J01EC,Intermediate-acting sulfonamides,"This group comprises sulfonamides with a biological half-life of approx. 11-12 hours."
J01ED,Long-acting sulfonamides,"This group comprises sulfonamides with a biological half-life of approx. 35 hours or more."
J01EE,Combinations of sulfonamides and trimethoprim incl. derivatives,"When establishing DDDs for combination products both components are taken into consideration see list of DDDs for combination products atcddd.fhi.no."
J01FA,Macrolides,"Erythromycin ethylsuccinate tablets have been assigned a higher DDD than other preparations of erythromycin due to a lower bio-availability. This DDD is mainly based on the dose recommendations. The oral DDD for azithromycin is based on a 5-day regimen."
J01FF,Lincosamides,"Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin have different DDDs due to different indications i.e. the intestinal and systemic infections respectively."
J01FG,Streptogramins,"The streptogramin components dalfopristin/quinupristin are semisynthetic derivatives of pristinamycin. The two components have synergistic antibacterial effect and are always used together. Quinupristin/dalfopristin are therefore classified at the ATC plain level J01FG02."
J01GA,Streptomycins,"Streptomycins in combination with antimycobacterials are classified in J04AM."
J01GB,Other aminoglycosides,"Tobramycin and amikacin for inhalation are classified together with the systemic formulations in J01GB01 and J01GB06 respectively."
J01MA,Fluoroquinolones,"Flumequine is classified in J01MB. Alalevonadifloxacin is classified in J01MA24 together with levonadifloxacin."
J01MB,Other quinolones,"Preparations which in addition contain a urine acidifier such as vitamin C calcium- or ammonium chloride are classified at the plain 5th levels."
J01RA,Combinations of antibacterials,"Combinations of urinary antiseptics and antiinfectives are classified in J01RA02."
J01XA,Glycopeptide antibacterials,"This group comprises glycopeptide antibacterials inhibiting the cell wall synthesis of gram positive bacteria. Lipoglycopeptide antibacterials are also included in this group. Teicoplanin and intravenous preparations of vancomycin are classified in this group. Oral formulations containing vancomycin are classified in A07A."
J01XB,Polymyxins,"This group comprises polymyxin antibacterials acting on the bacterial cytoplasm membrane. Oral formulations containing colistin are classified in A07A."
J01XC,Steroid antibacterials,"This group comprises steroid antibacterials inhibiting the binding of bacterial transfer-RNA and the 50-S part of the ribosomes."
J01XD,Imidazole derivatives,"This group comprises imidazole antibacterials acting through active metabolites in anaerobic bacteria."
J01XE,Nitrofuran derivatives,"Preparations which in addition contain a urine acidifier such as vitamin C calcium- or ammonium chloride are classified at the plain 5th levels."
J01XX,Other antibacterials,"Preparations which in addition contain a urine acidifier such as vitamin C calcium- or ammonium chloride are classified at the plain 5th levels."
